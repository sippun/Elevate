ToDoAdapter.java

Functional testing involved seeing if a list was viewable and interactable with both dummy data and data from Firebase.

Equivalence test cases with list of items:
  - ToDoItems with expected data
  - ToDoItems with invalid data
  - empty

Mainly the String name of ToDoItem is used, so test with ToDoItems with Strings containing strange characters or really long strings.


AddActivity.java

Functional testing involved checking Firebase console for data after setting up user input options.
